# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). 
I'm on a journey of learning how to code all over again by working on projects consistently for the next 30 days, so here's the solution to Day 1 of 30 Days of Consistency.

### What I learned

I learnt that I just really needed to take a step and start this challenge inspired by a friend of mine. In terms of the code, I learnt that the only way to remember what I knew but hadn't practiced in a while is by practicing.
